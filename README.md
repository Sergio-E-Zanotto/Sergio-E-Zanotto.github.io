# Sergio Eugenio Zanotto

## Who I am

I am a PhD candidate in Linguistics and an Independent Doctoral Fellow at the Cluster of Excellence “The Politics of Inequality”, University of Konstanz.

## My Interests

My research interests are at the intersection between politics and language use: I analyze political communication in social media and institutional contexts with computational methods. In my dissertation, “Profiling Populism in Political Texts”, I analyze populism as a political style, examining linguistic complexity in populist rhetoric, appeals to different social groups, and the registers that characterize populist discourse.
