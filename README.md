## Overview

I am a PhD candidate in Linguistics and an Independent Doctoral Fellow at the Cluster of Excellence "The Politics of Inequality," University of Konstanz. 
My research focuses on the creation and analysis of a corpus of Italian political discourses, aiming to understand which linguistic features are more relevant in attracting political preferences among different strata of the population.
