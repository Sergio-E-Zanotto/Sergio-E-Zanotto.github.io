## Who I am

I am a computational social scientist whose research focuses on the linguistic characterization of populist communication. I am currently completing my PhD at the Graduate School of Social and Behavioral Sciences at the University of Konstanz, Germany. I am affiliated with the Department of Linguistics and the Cluster of Excellence “The Politics of Inequality”, where I am an independent doctoral fellow.

Beyond my doctoral research, I work on projects exploring inequality categorization through survey data, biases in large language models, and the detection of machine-generated texts. I have also been a visiting fellow at the University of Florence, at the University of Texas at Austin, and at Hitotsubashi University in Tokyo.

## My Interests

My research sits at the intersection of political science and computational linguistics. Substantively, I am interested in how declining political accountability undermines trust in contemporary Western societies. To study these questions, I work on developing and evaluating trustworthy computational models for speech-to-text transcription, political promise tracking, and fact-checking.
